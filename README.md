# Project Euler

* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
* This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems
* I started to work through these problems as a way to keep my maths skills up to scratch, and to develop my coding skills
* The majority of solutions will be python scripts, with maybe a couple of sql scripts should the questions suit sql
* In the long term, I will aim to start producing solutions in other languages to keep developing my skills
* Problems with non-python solutions:
    - 19 in SQL
* Problems still needing solutions:
    - 38
